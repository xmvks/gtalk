# About GTalk 2025!
Google Talk 2025 Edition (GT25ED) is a clone of Google's old project, Google Talk.
Google Talk's lifespan is from 2005 to 2013. Wikipedia says that "In February 2015, the Windows client was discontinued and ceased to work, with Google recommending users to use Google Hangouts instead", which makes GTalk work for 10 not 8 years.

# Goal
My goal is to make a 2025 Edition that gives nostalgia, and simplicity.

# What i will (propably) add:
- New languages and country support.
GT25ED will be available in English, German, Polish, Swedish and Spanish. Rest of languages will need a lang pack *plugin*.
- Plugin support
For themes, languages, bots, embeds, In-call games that you can play while calling and some Whiteboard
